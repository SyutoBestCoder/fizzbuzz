The last lines sang in this song can indicate why this project is called "Coloring Book". Chance uses the fact that he and his significant other or someone he cares about don't use the same drugs anymore as a metaphor for them growing apart and maturing and going their own way. He names the project "Coloring Book" because it reminds him when he was a child and how everything was better or when "they did the same drugs" and how he was close to this special someone. Also the point of a coloring book is to color within the lines. When he sings "Don't you color out don't you bleed on out". this is just showing another way of him not wanting this person to change and grow away from him. The coloring book symbolizing how he and this special someone and all of the colors were withing the lines or together, and the action of coloring out side of the lines , as he states, is this special someone growing away form chance. Chance ultimately misses this person and is saddened that they had to leave each other and mature. This can explain the odd setting for this music video. It looks like some kind of children's show studio. Another instance of how he misses the past.
I don't know if this correct by any means. It's just something I picked up on.""")
